# Manual Test of Trivet

Someone out there knows how to craft an automated test that has a server and a client
with different classpaths, so we can test trivet RPC behavior when the server throws
an exception not present on the client classpath. That person is not me. So this repo
has a simple set of components that can be run by hand to verify things work as advertised.
